School District Analysis

The school board is concerned that there has been academic dishonesty at Thomas High School. They are concerned that reading and math grades for the ninth graders have been changed.
Maria has asked that the math and reading scores for the ninth graders be replaced with NaNs. The school district analysis needs to be rerun and a report written to describe how the changes affect the overall analysis.

I could not see how the district summary was affected. If it was, it was nominal. The changes would be at Thomas High School.
